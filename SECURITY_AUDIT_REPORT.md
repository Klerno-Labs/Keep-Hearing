# Security Audit Report - Keep Hearing Initiative Website

**Date:** January 30, 2025
**Auditor:** Claude (Automated Security Review)
**Scope:** Full website security audit for publicly exposed sensitive information

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately)

### 1. ✅ **FIXED: EIN (Employer Identification Number) Exposure**
**Status:** RESOLVED
**Original Issue:** EIN was displayed in footer and transparency page
**Risk Level:** HIGH - EIN is like SSN for organizations, can lead to identity theft
**Action Taken:** Removed all EIN references from public pages
**Current State:** No longer displayed anywhere on public website

---

### 2. 🚨 **CRITICAL: .env File in Git History**
**Status:** NEEDS IMMEDIATE ACTION
**Issue Found:** Your `.env` file was committed to Git in commit `0388e2a`
**What's Exposed:**
```
DATABASE_URL with password: "P0yrKqLeeo6q2TaK"
AUTH_SECRET: "3Da5kuyXvWLkRyxjKX3qexhx0xfQZHCMaVHow9F1jaQ="
Database IPv6 address: [2600:1f16:1cd0:332f:b77e:c717:e218:7e6b]
```

**Risk Level:** CRITICAL 🔥
**Consequences:**
- Anyone with access to your Git repository can see these credentials
- Database can be accessed remotely
- NextAuth sessions can be hijacked
- User data can be stolen or manipulated

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**

1. **Change Database Password NOW:**
   ```bash
   # Log into your PostgreSQL database and run:
   ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'NEW_SECURE_PASSWORD_HERE';
   ```

2. **Regenerate AUTH_SECRET:**
   ```bash
   # Run this to generate a new secret:
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

3. **Update .env file with new credentials**

4. **Remove .env from Git history:**
   ```bash
   # DANGER: This rewrites Git history. Backup first!
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
     "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" \
     --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

   # Force push (if repo is on GitHub/GitLab):
   git push origin --force --all
   ```

5. **Verify .env is in .gitignore:** ✅ Already done

## 🟡 MEDIUM ISSUES (Address Soon)

### 3. Email Addresses Publicly Displayed
**Status:** ACCEPTABLE (Common practice for nonprofits)
**Locations:**
- [Contact Page](src/app/contact/page.tsx):
  - `info@keephearing.org`
  - `donations@keephearing.org`
  - `research@keephearing.org`
- [Privacy Policy](src/app/privacy/page.tsx): `info@keephearing.org`
- [Homepage Schema.org](src/app/page.tsx): `info@keephearing.org`

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM
**Risks:**
- Email harvesting by spam bots
- Phishing attempts
- Increased spam volume

**Recommendation:** KEEP THEM (with protections)
**Why:** Nonprofits need to be contactable. It's legally required and builds trust.

**Mitigation Options:**
1. **Use Contact Form Instead** (Recommended)
   - Replace email links with form submission
   - Emails go through server, not exposed
   - Current form is already built but not functional

2. **Email Obfuscation** (Quick fix)
   - Write as `info [at] keephearing [dot] org`
   - Use JavaScript to decode emails
   - Less user-friendly

3. **Spam Filtering** (Easiest)
   - Set up Google Workspace or similar
   - Use spam filters
   - Accept that some spam is inevitable

**My Recommendation:** Keep emails as-is. It's standard practice and expected by donors/participants.

---

### 4. Admin Panel Access
**Status:** ✅ PROTECTED
**Finding:** Admin panel requires authentication
**Location:** `/admin`
**Protection:** NextAuth with role-based access
**Security Level:** GOOD

**Verified Protections:**
- ✅ Not accessible without login
- ✅ Requires admin role
- ✅ Session-based authentication
- ✅ CSRF protection via NextAuth

**No action needed** - properly secured

---

## 🟢 LOW ISSUES (Best Practices)

### 5. Board Member Information
**Status:** PLACEHOLDER (Not real data)
**Location:** [Transparency Page](src/app/transparency/page.tsx)
**Current:** "Board Member Name - President" (generic placeholder)
**Risk:** None (not real information)

**When You Add Real Board Members:**
- ✅ **DO include:** Names, titles, professional backgrounds
- ❌ **DON'T include:** Home addresses, personal phone numbers, SSNs
- ✅ **OPTIONAL:** LinkedIn profiles, professional bios

**Recommendation:** Keep as-is until you have real board member info

---

### 6. Social Media Links
**Status:** ✅ SAFE
**Exposed Information:**
- TikTok: `@keephearing`
- Instagram: `@keephearing`
- Substack: `@keephearing`

**Risk:** NONE - These are intentionally public profiles
**No action needed**

---

### 7. Domain and Hosting Information
**Status:** WILL BE PUBLIC WHEN DEPLOYED
**Current:** Local development only
**Future:** Vercel or similar hosting

**What Will Be Public (This is Normal):**
- Domain registration: keephearing.org
- Hosting provider: Vercel
- DNS records: Public by design
- SSL certificate: Public by design

**Risk:** NONE - This is how the internet works
**No action needed**

---

## ✅ THINGS THAT ARE PROPERLY SECURED

### What's NOT Exposed (Good!):
1. ✅ **EIN** - Removed from public pages
2. ✅ **Database credentials** - Not in source code (only in .env)
3. ✅ **Admin passwords** - Hashed in database
4. ✅ **User passwords** - Hashed with bcrypt
5. ✅ **API keys** - None currently in use
6. ✅ **Payment credentials** - Not yet configured
7. ✅ **Session tokens** - Encrypted by NextAuth
8. ✅ **Admin panel** - Authentication required

3. **Update .env file** - Replace old credentials with new ones
4. **Restart dev server** - Test that everything still works

### THIS WEEK:
1. **Remove .env from Git history** - Use git filter-branch command above
2. **Force push to remote** - If you have GitHub/GitLab repo
3. **Verify .env is in .gitignore** - ✅ Already done
4. **Test all functionality** - Make sure new credentials work

### BEFORE LAUNCH:
1. **Set environment variables in Vercel** - Don't use .env in production
2. **Enable HTTPS** - Automatic with Vercel
3. **Test security** - Try to access admin without login
4. **Set up contact form backend** - Currently just a demo
