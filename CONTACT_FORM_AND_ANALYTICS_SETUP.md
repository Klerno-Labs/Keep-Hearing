## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Part 1: Contact Form Email Setup

You have two options for handling contact form submissions:

#### **Option A: Email Service (Recommended)**

1. **Sign up for Resend** (free tier available)
   - Go to: https://resend.com/
   - Create an account
   - Verify your domain (if you own keephearing.org)
   - Get your API key

2. **Add Resend API Key to .env**
   ```bash
   RESEND_API_KEY="re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
   ```

3. **Configure sender email** (edit `/src/app/api/contact/route.ts` line 60)
   - If you verified your domain:
     ```typescript
     from: "Contact Form <noreply@keephearing.org>",
     ```
   - If using Resend's test domain:
     ```typescript
     from: "Contact Form <onboarding@resend.dev>",
     ```

4. **Set recipient email** (line 61)
   ```typescript
   to: ["your-email@keephearing.org"],
   ```

#### **Option B: Database Storage (Fallback)**

If you don't set up Resend, messages will be stored in your PostgreSQL database. You'll need to:

1. **Create the contact_submissions table**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE contact_submissions (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     subject VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
     message TEXT NOT NULL,
     ip_address VARCHAR(45),
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
     status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'unread'
   );
   ```

2. **Check submissions regularly**
   - Use a database client to query: `SELECT * FROM contact_submissions WHERE status = 'unread'`
   - Or create an admin page to view submissions

---

### Part 2: Google Analytics 4 Setup

1. **Create a Google Analytics 4 Property**
   - Go to: https://analytics.google.com/
   - Create a new GA4 property
   - Name it "Keep Hearing Initiative"
   - Set timezone to your location
   - Accept terms and conditions

2. **Get Your Measurement ID**
   - In GA4, go to: Admin ‚Üí Data Streams
   - Click on your web data stream
   - Copy the **Measurement ID** (format: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)

3. **Add Measurement ID to .env**
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID="G-XXXXXXXXXX"
   ```
   (Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Measurement ID)

4. **Restart your development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Verify Analytics is Working**
   - Open your website in a browser
   - Accept cookies when the banner appears
   - Check GA4 Real-time reports (Admin ‚Üí Reports ‚Üí Realtime)
   - You should see your visit within 30 seconds

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Contact Form Not Working

**"Failed to send message"**
- Check if `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in .env
- Verify Resend API key is valid
- Check server logs for detailed error

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
- Wait 15 minutes before trying again
- This is normal protection against spam

**No email received**
- Check spam folder
- Verify recipient email in `/src/app/api/contact/route.ts`
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery status

### Analytics Not Tracking

**No data in GA4**
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` is in .env
- Restart dev server after adding .env variable
- Accept analytics cookies on the website
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify GA4 Measurement ID is correct

**Tracking after "Necessary Only" cookies**
- This is expected behavior - analytics only loads with consent
- Clear localStorage and re-accept all cookies

### Cookie Banner Not Showing

- Check browser localStorage for "cookieConsent"
- Clear localStorage to reset consent
- Wait 1 second after page load (banner has delay)
