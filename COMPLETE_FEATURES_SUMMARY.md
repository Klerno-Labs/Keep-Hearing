## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to set up Resend to use the contact form?

**A:** No! The contact form will work without Resend. Submissions will be saved to the database and you can view them in the admin panel. However, you won't receive email notifications unless you set up Resend.

### Q: How do I change the admin email address?

**A:** Edit [src/app/api/contact/route.ts](src/app/api/contact/route.ts#L83) and change the email in the `to` field:

```typescript
to: ["your-email@example.com"], // Change this
```

### Q: Can I customize the email templates?

**A:** Yes! Edit [src/lib/email-templates.ts](src/lib/email-templates.ts). You can change:
- Colors (see `brandColors` object)
- Text content
- Layout
- Links
- Branding

### Q: How do I delete the contact submission database table?

**A:** Don't! But if you really need to:

```bash
# Create a migration to remove it
npx prisma migrate dev --name remove_contact_submissions

# In the migration file, add:
# DROP TABLE "ContactSubmission";
```

### Q: The auto-reply links point to localhost. How do I fix for production?

**A:** The templates will automatically use the correct domain in production. The links use relative paths, so when deployed, they'll use your production domain.

Or manually update in [src/lib/email-templates.ts](src/lib/email-templates.ts) and replace `http://localhost:3000` with your domain.

### Q: Can users attach files to contact form?

**A:** Not yet, but you can add this feature! You'd need to:
1. Add file upload field to form
2. Store files in cloud storage (Cloudinary, AWS S3, etc.)
3. Include file links in emails
4. Show attachments in admin panel

### Q: How do I export all contact submissions?

**A:** You can use Prisma Studio (`npx prisma studio`) to export as JSON, or add a CSV export feature to the admin panel.

Quick export via command line:
```bash
# Run this in your terminal
node -e "
require('./src/lib/prisma').prisma.contactSubmission.findMany()
  .then(data => console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)))
"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Contact form submits but nothing happens

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check dev server logs
3. Verify database connection
4. Check that Prisma Client is generated: `npx prisma generate`

### Admin panel shows "No submissions found"

1. Submit a test form first
2. Check database with `npx prisma studio`
3. Look for ContactSubmission table
4. Verify API endpoint works: visit `http://localhost:3000/api/admin/contact-submissions`

### Emails not sending

1. Check that `RESEND_API_KEY` is in `.env`
2. Check Resend dashboard logs
3. Verify API key is valid
4. Check spam folder
5. Try sending a test email via Resend dashboard

### "Unauthorized" error in admin panel

1. Make sure you're signed in
2. Verify your user has ADMIN or SUPERADMIN role
3. Check admin panel requirements in [src/app/admin/layout.tsx](src/app/admin/layout.tsx)

### TypeScript errors after adding new features

1. Restart TypeScript server in VS Code
2. Run: `npx tsc --noEmit` to check errors
3. Regenerate Prisma Client: `npx prisma generate`
4. Restart dev server

---

## Performance Notes

### Database Queries

All contact submission queries are optimized with:
- Indexed status field for filtering
- Indexed createdAt for sorting
- Pagination support (limit/offset)
- Parallel queries using `Promise.all()`

### Email Sending

- Emails are sent in parallel (admin + auto-reply)
- Non-blocking (app continues if email fails)
- Graceful fallback to database-only if no email service

### Admin Panel

- Auto-refresh only when tab is visible (saves resources)
- Debounced search (if you add search feature)
- Lazy loading (only loads when tab is clicked)

---

## Security Features

### Contact Form Protection

- ✅ Rate limiting (3 per 15 min per IP)
- ✅ Input sanitization (XSS prevention)
- ✅ Email validation
- ✅ Spam keyword detection
- ✅ CSRF protection
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (Prisma)
- ✅ Max length restrictions

### Admin Panel Protection

- ✅ Authentication required
- ✅ Role-based access control (ADMIN/SUPERADMIN)
- ✅ Audit logging for all actions
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Secure cookie handling

### Email Security

- ✅ Environment variables for API keys
- ✅ No sensitive data in emails (IP address only for admin)
- ✅ Sender verification (domain setup)
