# Keep-Hearing Security Audit - Initial Findings

## Audit Date: 2025-10-29

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive security audit and stress testing of the Keep-Hearing application, identifying vulnerabilities, testing edge cases, and implementing fixes to create an unbreakable system.

---

## 1. CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FOUND

### 1.1 Environment Variable Exposure
**Severity: CRITICAL**
- `.env` file contains plaintext database credentials with public IPv6 address
- Database URL: `postgres://postgres:P0yrKqLeeo6q2TaK@[2600:1f16:1cd0:332f:b77e:c717:e218:7e6b]:5432/postgres`
- **Risk**: Anyone with access to the repo can access the production database
- **Fix Required**: Move to secure secret management (Vercel Env Vars, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)

### 1.2 Missing Rate Limiting
**Severity: HIGH**
- No rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- No rate limiting on API routes
- **Risk**: Brute force attacks, DoS, credential stuffing
- **Fix Required**: Implement rate limiting using Upstash Redis or middleware

### 1.3 Donation API Lacks Authentication
**Severity: HIGH**
- `POST /api/donations` doesn't require authentication
- Anyone can create donations with arbitrary amounts
- No CSRF protection on donation creation
- **Risk**: Fraud, data manipulation, fake donation records
- **Fix Required**: Require authentication or implement CSRF token validation

### 1.4 Missing Input Sanitization for User-Generated Content
**Severity: MEDIUM**
- User names and emails are not sanitized for XSS
- No HTML encoding on display
- **Risk**: Stored XSS attacks
- **Fix Required**: Implement DOMPurify or similar sanitization

### 1.5 Weak Password Reset Flow
**Severity: MEDIUM**
- No password reset functionality implemented
- **Risk**: Users locked out permanently if they forget password
- **Fix Required**: Implement secure password reset with email verification

---

## 2. DATABASE SCHEMA VULNERABILITIES

### 2.1 Schema Issues
- Donation model has `amount` field referenced in admin dashboard but schema shows `amountCents`
- Missing constraints on donation amounts (negative values possible)
- User soft delete is implemented but no cascade handling for related records
- No audit trail for donation modifications

### 2.2 Index Analysis
- Good: Proper indexes on frequently queried fields (email, userId, deletedAt)
- Missing: Index on Donation.createdAt for performance on recent donations query
- Missing: Composite index on AuditLog (action, createdAt) for filtering

---

## 3. AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION ISSUES

### 3.1 JWT Configuration
- Session maxAge: 30 days (reasonable)
- JWT secret properly configured via environment variable
- No JWT refresh token mechanism

### 3.2 Role-Based Access Control
- Good: Three-tier role system (STAFF, ADMIN, SUPERADMIN)
- Issue: No difference between ADMIN and SUPERADMIN permissions
- Issue: STAFF role has no protected routes
- Missing: Ability to limit SUPERADMIN creation

### 3.3 Session Management
- No logout audit trail implementation
- No session invalidation on password change
- No concurrent session limit

---

## 4. API SECURITY ANALYSIS

### 4.1 CSRF Protection
- CSRF token generation exists but `csrfGuard` returns `null` (disabled)
- Comment states "NextAuth v5 has built-in CSRF protection"
- **Risk**: Custom API routes not protected by NextAuth CSRF

### 4.2 API Route Vulnerabilities

#### `/api/users`
- Properly protected with `requireAdmin`
- Good input validation with Zod
- Missing: Email change should require verification
- Missing: Prevent changing own role
- Missing: Activity logging for bulk operations

#### `/api/donations`
- **CRITICAL**: POST route doesn't require authentication
- GET requires admin (good)
- PATCH/DELETE require admin (good)
- Missing: Validation on provider and providerId format
- Missing: Duplicate detection on providerId

#### `/api/admin/dashboard`
- References non-existent `amount` field (should be `amountCents`)
- References non-existent `name` field on donation
- Missing error handling for database failures

#### `/api/csrf-token`
- Cookie settings are secure (HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict, Secure)
- But CSRF validation is disabled in middleware

---

## 5. MIDDLEWARE SECURITY

### 5.1 Content Security Policy
- CSP is implemented but allows `unsafe-inline` for styles
- Allows all HTTPS images (`img-src 'self' data: https:`)
- **Risk**: XSS via inline styles, image-based attacks

### 5.2 Security Headers
- Good: X-Frame-Options: DENY
- Good: X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Good: Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Missing: Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- Missing: X-XSS-Protection header

---

## 6. AUDIT LOGGING GAPS

### 6.1 Implemented Audit Actions
- User CRUD operations logged
- Login/logout tracked
- Donation operations logged
- Admin access logged

### 6.2 Missing Audit Logs
- Failed authorization attempts not logged with details
- Bulk operations not logged individually
- No IP address tracking
- No user agent tracking
- No geolocation tracking for suspicious access
- Export operations logged but no details about what was exported

---

## 7. VALIDATION ISSUES

### 7.1 User Validation
- Good: Strong password requirements (8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)
- Good: Email validation
- Good: CUID validation for IDs
- Missing: Special character requirement for passwords
- Missing: Password complexity scoring
- Missing: Common password blacklist

### 7.2 Donation Validation
- Good: Amount must be positive
- Good: Currency length validation
- Missing: Maximum amount limit
- Missing: Decimal precision validation
- Missing: Provider-specific ID format validation

---

## 8. ERROR HANDLING & INFORMATION DISCLOSURE

### 8.1 Error Messages
- Generic error messages (good for security)
- Console.error logs sensitive information
- No structured error logging
- Missing: Error rate monitoring

### 8.2 Information Disclosure
- Stack traces might be exposed in development mode
- Database errors could leak schema information
- No sanitization of error messages before sending to client

---

## 9. DEPENDENCY VULNERABILITIES

### 9.1 Packages to Audit
Run `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities in:
- next-auth (beta version - may have undiscovered issues)
- @prisma/client
- bcryptjs
- Other dependencies

---

## 10. TESTING GAPS

- NextRequest mock issues in security tests
- SignIn page component tests failing

### 10.2 Missing Test Coverage
- No integration tests for payment flows
