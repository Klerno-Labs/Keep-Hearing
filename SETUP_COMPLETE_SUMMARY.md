## What's Ready to Use Right Now

### Contact Form
- URL: `http://localhost:3000/contact`
- Features:
  - Rate limiting (3 submissions per 15 minutes per IP)
  - Email validation
  - Spam detection
  - Input sanitization
  - Database storage
  - Ready for email notifications (needs API key)

### Database Schema
All tables are created and ready:
- Users (with soft delete)
- Donations
- Contact Submissions (NEW)
- Audit Logs
- Promo codes
- NextAuth tables (Account, Session, VerificationToken)

## Next Steps (Require Your Action)

### Priority 1: Email Notifications
**Time Required**: 10-15 minutes

1. Follow [RESEND_EMAIL_SETUP.md](RESEND_EMAIL_SETUP.md) to:
   - Create a free Resend account
   - Get your API key
   - Add it to `.env` file
   - Update recipient email in [src/app/api/contact/route.ts](src/app/api/contact/route.ts#L72)

**Why it matters**: Without this, contact form submissions only save to database - no email notifications

### Priority 2: Google Analytics
**Time Required**: 15-20 minutes

1. Follow [GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SETUP.md](GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SETUP.md) to:
   - Create GA4 account
   - Set up property and data stream
   - Get Measurement ID
   - Add to `.env` file

**Why it matters**: Track visitors, understand user behavior, measure impact

### Priority 3: Admin Panel Access
**Time Required**: 5 minutes

To view contact form submissions in the admin panel:

1. Sign in at `http://localhost:3000/signin`
2. Navigate to Admin Panel
3. We'll need to add a "Contact Submissions" section

Would you like me to add a Contact Submissions viewer to the admin panel?

## Testing the Contact Form

1. **Without Email Service** (Current State):
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:3000/contact
   Fill out form → Submit → Check database
   ```

   To verify in database:
   ```bash
   npx prisma studio
   ```
   Look for ContactSubmission table

2. **With Email Service** (After Resend Setup):
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:3000/contact
   Fill out form → Submit → Check email + database
   ```
